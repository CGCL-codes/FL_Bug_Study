https://github.com/tensorflow/federated/pull/828,['cla: yes'],Implement ExecutionTracingProvider for simpler logging,"Implement ExecutionTracingProvider for simpler loggingThese commits introduce an ExecutionTracingProvider that traces the evolution of a federated computation through a given executor stack. We've found this to be helpful for both learning and debugging the core TFF framework. After monkey-patching executors with [logging helpers](https://github.com/tf-encrypted/rfcs/blob/master/20190924-tensorflow-federated/logging_helpers.py) for this purpose, we found the recently introduced TracingProvider mechanism to be ideal for integrating these properly into the library, and thought they might be useful to other newcomers. As noted in the documentation, this implementation does not attempt to handle logs written from asynchronous calls, so use with e.g. the ThreadDelegatingExecutor is not recommended.These dependencies will require that this tracing utility have a privileged visibility. I think where it is located is probably the appropriate location given the dependencies. But let me ask, is it possible to remove these dependencies? It seems to me like you are simply stripping the module name from all non-primative types? I think we could do this without having an inclusion list of types that we check against. Additionally, we would not have to come back and add more when we add executors.Nit: I would suggest that we not alias the self describing name to something that is less self describing or we choose that the shorter name is self describing and rename the method to that. The alias seems unnecessary.Can you use single quotes throughout the change consistently? I'm not sure that we have 100% parity between internal and external lint, but I know this fails internally.NOTE -> Note, it renders better with our documentation generationYou could break this out into a different PR, probably not worth it, but if you wanted to this change is unrelated and does not require the same level of review.That's a good point -- this code grew out of some hastier monkey-patching code, which required the actual types. I'll remove them.

On the other hand, I'm trying to think through how we would differentiate between, for example, an executor and an executor value without building up inclusion lists. One possibility would be matching on the type name, but that doesn't feel robust. Do you have any alternatives in mind?I'll comment inline in the iteration you pushed.It seems like all format strategies could be combined based on capabilities instead of class. So instead of:

for executor_base.Executor, EagerTensor
`'<{class} @{id}>'`

for executor_value_base.ExecutorValue
`'<{class} @{id} : {type_signature}>'`

for executor_value_base.AnonymousTuple
`'<{class} @{id} : {value}>'`

for computation_types.Type
`'<{class}>'`

for float, int
`'<{value} : {class}>'`

for None
`'-'`

for list, tuple
`'<{element 1}, {element 2}, ...>'`

for ComputationImpl ComputationPB
`'<{class} {context} @{id} : {type_signature}>'`

for IntrinsicDef
`'<{class} {uri} {type_signature} @{id}>'`

you could use: ` '<{class} {context} @{id}: {value}'`, where:

* special case None
* everything has a `class`
* ComputationImpl and ComputationPB have a `context` based on proto
* IntrinsicDef has a `context` based on URI
* everything else has no `context`
* everything as an `id`
* things with type_signature have a `value` of type_signature
* things with a value have a `value` of value
* everything else has no `value`

This make the problem a lot smaller... And makes the representations more consistent.

Maybe we can use duck-typing to get rid of the dependencies? Or maybe drop those differences? Or maybe fork on base classes instead of the individual subclasses? WDYT?

This seems useful! I do think the differences matter to make the end result readable, so I'm inclined to choose duck-typing or forking. I think I slightly prefer duck-typing; we can think of these differences as loosely defined ""traits"" that are agnostic to the underlying type, which means we can avoid the imports. The only improvement I can imagine would be to let the types themselves handle this explicitly, or perhaps to pass in a differentiator as a trace_opt, but both of those alternatives seem invasive for something that's meant to be a simple & lightweight developer tool.

If there are no objections, I'll refactor the PR with all this in mind in the next day or two.+1 to ""let the types themselves handle this explicitly"". This would be nice, and I agree this is more invasive.I was kind of hoping that the indentation level here could be moved into the span yield infra. That is, that the output data could be logically organized underneath its parent by using the parenting abilities offered by `span`. This would mean that either (a) output wouldn't be available to the end of the program or (b) the output would be printed sort of ""backwards"", listing parent spans *below* their children. Both of these are sort of unfortunate, but either would make this provider compatible with the more complicated (but more common) executor setups involving concurrency. What do you think about this idea? I feel somewhat uneasy about offering a debugging utility that will print incorrect results for most users' default configurations.Nit: since this doesn't use the class, I don't think this belongs as a class method. It seems more like a private helper function, such as `_pattern_union` above.I like this idea a lot, I hadn't quite connected those dots before. When I get a chance to revisit this PR, I'll give this a shot",13,False,2020-04-17 16:42:43,2022-01-31 17:45:30,2022-01-31 17:45:30
https://github.com/tensorflow/federated/pull/826,['cla: yes'],Introduce an IntrinsicStrategy abstraction for the FederatingExecutor.,"Introduce an IntrinsicStrategy abstraction for the FederatingExecutor.We introduce intrinsic strategies as a way of specifying alternative interpretations of the existing intrinsics. Our intention is for intrinsic strategies to provide a pluggable abstraction for computing intrinsics securely with primitives from the [TF Encrypted](https://github.com/tf-encrypted/tf-encrypted) project, as detailed in this [RFC](https://github.com/tf-encrypted/rfcs/tree/master/20190924-tensorflow-federated). One motivating example for our design, detailed in the linked RFC, would be to replace the existing federated_sum intrinsic with one that aggregates client-federated data via Paillier addition on an Aggregator placement. Although originally our intent was to introduce a new Executor class for this kind of functionality, further inspection & TODOs in the existing code suggested that the TFF team intends to add similar or orthogonal functionality directly to the FederatingExecutor (e.g. via federated_secure_sum, intermediate aggregator placements, etc.).

While this series of commits only includes the base class and existing functionality copied from the FederatingExecutor over to a default CentralizedIntrinsicStrategy, we have additional work on [our own fork's master branch](https://github.com/tf-encrypted/federated) that implements a [TrustedAggregatorIntrinsicStrategy](https://github.com/tf-encrypted/federated/blob/1856d65c590565c421c579c5952391baf2264b29/tensorflow_federated/python/core/impl/executors/federating_executor.py#L459). This strategy uses an additional AGGREGATORS placement literal and delegates all reduce-type intrinsics to the executor(s) placed with that literal. To demonstrate some notion of increased security between these placements, we additionally implemented custom TF kernels (2.1 compatible) for leveraging libsodium for secure channels between e.g. the CLIENTS and AGGREGATORS, which may be of independent interest to the team.The implementation here should be delegated to the strategy as well. In the short term the strategy will still delegate to this function, but that can probably eventually be inlined.This should be delegated to intrinsic_strategy and implemented on the strategy to delegate to this function. In the long term I think we can probably inline the implementation of this function in the strategy.WDYT about simply calling this a `strategy`, I think this is going to need to handle more than just federated computations.works for me. are you referring to the base Executor methods?I think this was an oversight -- there is already a `federated_weighted_mean` implemented on the strategy, we just never properly delegatedthere are some naming inconsistencies that need to be fixed (cf `self.federating_executor` elsewhere). please ignore thesethe attribute on the federating_executor.sorry, I was referring to what does ""more than federated computations"" refer to, but I think we're in sync about this after today's conversationfixedI don't think we need this. Seems like we should simply move this to the init function fo the strategy. No reason to check this in the construction of the executor?Actually this makes sense why you have this because in this iteration it's the executor that owns the child executors. I would either leave as is (and I will remove it in follow up) or just remove it and inline. IT doesn't matter much which you choose I think? WDYT?I think these additional diffs are happening because I sorted the methods alphabetically since you did this refactor. I think restoring this would reveal that there are actually much less diff that it appears.Yep, it seemed like this could be cut out with your change. I'm okay with leaving as is if you are!This makes sense, I'll make that change shortlyfixed",3,True,2020-04-15 22:20:09,2020-06-22 17:01:28,2020-06-22 17:01:27
