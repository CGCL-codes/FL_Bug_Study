https://github.com/adap/flower/pull/1233	[]	Fixes metrics in the C++ implementation and example	"Fixes metrics in the C++ implementation and example#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.

Fixes to the C++ implementation and the quickstart C++ example:
- Fixes metrics communication issue with pointer going out of scope
- Adds an example metric to the quickstart C++ example
- Fixes bug in the matrix multiplication function for the C++ example.
- Adds double support for compatibility```suggestion

```Is this still required or can we revert the changes in `transport.proto`? If we add support for `float` here, we'll have to update at least the Python-based server implementation to support it as well.We don't have to modify the proto if we drop all float support. If we want to keep only doubles, I think some changes should still be made to the interface of typing.h for consistency. I've updated the PR to reflect these changes."	2	True	2022-05-25 12:37:57	2022-06-13 07:17:59	2022-06-01 09:41:07

https://github.com/adap/flower/pull/748	[]	Adding sklearn logreg example	"Adding sklearn logreg exampleAdding a scikit-learn logistic regression example using MNIST dataset.
The openml helper in scikit-learn is broken, so I used the openml python library directly.
I tried to make this as simple as possible following the quickstart examples but it turned out little complicated since model initialisation and parameter setting is a not so obvious with scikit-learn.```suggestion
This example of Flower uses `scikit-learn`'s `LogisticRegression` model to train a federated learning system. It will help you understand how to adapt Flower for use with `scikit-learn`.

    Sets initial parameters as zeros
    Required for since model params are uninitialized until model.fit is called
    But server asks for initial parameters from clients at launch
